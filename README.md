# Poverty, food acess, diet, and health

data from the USDA's [Food Environment Atlas](http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas.aspx)

### Poverty and health
Obesity and diabetes prevalence correlate with poverty in US counties

### Vendor availability
See the number of food vendors (and relative availability!) in counties with increasing poverty

### Predict obesity
How well does food access, food availability, and poverty predict obesity? Which of these factors are most predictive of obesity?

### Food choice
Health is not only determined by food access (in fact the previous figure suggests that food access does not play a significant role!). Diet effects on health may be due to the choice we make about what food to consume. There are many reasons why poverty may correlate with less healthy food choices and we show here that poverty correlates with a higher percentage of meals at fast food restaurants.
